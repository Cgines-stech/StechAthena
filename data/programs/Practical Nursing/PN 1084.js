    courseDescription:
      'Skills and Simulation Lab II provides you an on-campus practice environment where you will transfer and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes acquired in the  classroom and skills lab setting. The professional standards of QSEN provide the context for this course to guide your learning and provide meaningful purpose. You will  perform fundamental nursing skills in the simulated setting, with opportunity to review performance and discuss opportunities for growth within your own and other  students’ experiences. When you have completed this course, you will be able to use the nursing process to provide patient-centered care to clients in a variety of settings.',

    courseObjectives: [
      "Demonstrate basic clinical competence through performance of fundamental nursing skills (EPSLO # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).",
      "Apply the aspects of NPSG to client care (EPSLO # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).",
      'Demonstrate the use of "the Six Rights" when simulating medication administration (EPSLO # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).',
      "Categorize priority client information to complete SBAR communication (EPSLO # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).",
      "Apply fundamental nursing skills to client care in emergent situations (EPSLO # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).",
      "Model AACN Essentials while simulating care for clients (EPSLO # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).",
      "Utilize the Nursing Process while simulating patient care during emergent situations (EPSLO # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).",
      "Demonstrate proper assessment techniques as they apply to infants, children, adolescents, and adults (EPSLO # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)",
