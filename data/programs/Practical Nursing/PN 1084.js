    courseDescription:
      'Skills and Simulation Lab II provides you an on-campus practice environment where you will transfer and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes acquired in the  classroom and skills lab setting. The professional standards of QSEN provide the context for this course to guide your learning and provide meaningful purpose. You will  perform fundamental nursing skills in the simulated setting, with opportunity to review performance and discuss opportunities for growth within your own and other  students’ experiences. When you have completed this course, you will be able to use the nursing process to provide patient-centered care to clients in a variety of settings.',

          "<strong>Instructor Information and Course Requirements:</strong> The instructor will be available for more individualized questions during class breaks and by appointment. Students are expected to arrive on time to class ready to learn, having completed pre-class assignments and the required reading.",
          "<strong>Grading:</strong> A cumulative average 80% or better is expected on all course requirements. Evaluation methods will include: Tickets to class (10%), Tests and quizzes (40%), Assignments (25%), and Class participation/professional behavior (25%). If a student's grade falls below 80%, an Academic Intervention Plan will be initiated, requiring remediation for successful course completion. A cumulative test average of 80% is required to pass the course.",
          "<strong>Remediation:</strong> Remediation, if available, must be requested within 24 hours of the original assignment/test completion.",
          "<strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> The use of generative AI (ChatGPT etc.) is not banned for this course. AI may be used as a tool to assist with the generation of ideas, but it may not be used to replace student work and is not an approved source for cited information",
          "<strong>Attendance:</strong> It is expected students will attend all scheduled classes. In the event of an absence, the student is responsible for content discussed in class. Habitual tardiness or absences will be handled on a case by case basis.",

        title: "Attendance: Didactic Class",
        content: [
          "The didactic curriculum will be covered over two semesters. Students who are not in class will be unable to learn and miss needed information; therefore, attendance is mandatory. If an absence is unavoidable, the student must notify the instructor prior to the absence when possible. An absence is defined as more than 15 minutes of missed class time, regardless of whether missed time occurs at the beginning, middle, or end of a scheduled class. Following the second absence, each subsequent absence will result in a 5% reduction in the student's overall theory grade. Breaks will be provided at specified intervals throughout the class sessions to attend to personal needs. Mobile phones and other electronic devices must remain in silent mode throughout the duration of the class. Please do not disrupt the class by receiving calls, being paged, or leaving inappropriately. Excessive text messaging/social media during class will not be tolerated. Use of the technologies, as mentioned above, during class will result in students being asked to leave for the remainder of the class with an absence recorded on their attendance record. Should any specific issues arise, students should discuss them with the instructor.",

The determination of tardiness will be made at the discretion of the faculty.",
