      "Safety: The safety of all students and patients is taken very seriously. Personal safety, followed by the safety of the EMS partner, and then the patient is the first skill taught and the most often discussed aspect of EMS. All rules outlined in this syllabus as well as rules given in class throughout the course pertaining to specific skills and concepts including, but not limited to lifting & moving, glucose testing, IV access, spinal immobilization, vital signs, patient assessments, communication, etc. are expected to be followed precisely to ensure the safe practice of emergency medicine in the classroom as well as the field.

      "Cell Phone Use: During class hours, phones are to be turned on silent and only used for EMS related learning. Breaks are given during class at which time personal use of phones is appropriate. Misuse of cell phone, tablet or laptop during class may result in dismissal of the course and failure to be recommended for testing.",
      "Attendance: Students must attend or make up all hours of T classroom time in order to be recommended for testing. Missing more than 15 hours of classroom time will result in the student not being recommended for testing. Students must be in their seats, in appropriate EMT uniform and ready to learn when class begins.",
      "See Course Coordinator to schedule make up time. No Exceptions. All final decisions regarding recommendations to test will be determined by the Course Coordinator and the Medical Director."
