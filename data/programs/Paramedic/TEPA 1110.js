    courseDescription:
      "The Paramedic Fundamentals course integrates topics such as EMS communications, the safety/well-being of the paramedic, medical/legal responsibilities, ethical issues, and research in EMS. Students learn pharmacology, pathophysiology, history taking, ventilatory management, suctioning, IV therapy, sterile techniques, medications/administration, medical terminology, cardiac emergency treatment, and patient assessment. The course reinforces concepts and clinical skills students previously learned at the EMT level. It introduces advanced concepts in EMS Systems, illness and injury prevention, medical-legal issues, anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, and childbirth.",

    courseObjectives: [
      "Discriminate between normal and abnormal anatomy and physiology and distinguish these characteristics as they relate to pathophysiology.",
      "Interpret complex medical, legal, and ethical issues in EMS.",
      "Outline factors that impact the health and wellness of the paramedic and correlate these with behaviors that promote a culture of safety.",
      "Explain variations in the assessment and management of the Adult and Pediatric airway.",
      "Explain fundamental principles of public health, health promotion, and illness and injury prevention.",
      "Identify cardiac patient electrophysiology, basic monitoring techniques and ECG rhythms recognition.",
      "Assess and treat patients who may be experiencing a cardiovascular disorder.",
