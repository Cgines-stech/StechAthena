    courseDescription:
      "The Paramedic Fundamentals Lab course provides practical learning of skills and National Registry competencies including comprehensive patient assessment of adult and pediatric patients, history taking, medical assessment, advanced cardiac life support, advanced airway management, CPAP, ventilator use, IV insertion, medication administration, and IO insertion. Students demonstrate competency in the National Standard Curriculum. The course reinforces concepts and clinical skills students previously learned at the EMT level. It introduces advanced concepts in cardiology, airway management, respiratory distress, and resuscitation. Students learn to identify patient assessment and management within the paramedicâ€™s scope of care.",

    courseObjectives: [
      "Demonstrate competency in performing head-to-toe patient assessment.",
      "Perform advanced airway management.",
      "Manage advanced cardiac care and recognize acute life-threatening situations.",
      "Identify and apply cognitive, psychomotor, and affective skills in a simulated out-of-hospital environment.",
      "Demonstrate and record performance in the NREMT lab portfolio.",
      "Integrate the pathophysiology, assessment, and management of the medical patient.",
      "Analyze advanced patient assessment findings and formulate management of these emergencies within the paramedic scope of practice.",
