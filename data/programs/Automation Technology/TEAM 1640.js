    courseDescription:
      "In this course, students will study and master the wiring and use of real-world components such as a 3-phase motor, pushbuttons, switches, valves, and the use of  a 24VDC control power supply. Students will use these components to study electrical control system wiring, pneumatic control circuit wiring, conductors, disconnects, and  overcurrent protection and related applications. The combination of industrial components, and comprehensive curriculum will reinforce electrical wiring concepts and skills  to build up the studentsâ€™ confidence and competence.",

    courseObjectives: [
      "Install control wiring in an electrical panel to control and manipulate commonly used components and motors.",
      "Understand, identify, and calculate the proper wire size, materials, and insulation required for different circuits, applications, and panel requirements.",
      "Install, wire, and monitor different types of control components and sensors. Including but not limited to contacts, momentary push buttons, limit switches solenoids, and pressure switches.",
