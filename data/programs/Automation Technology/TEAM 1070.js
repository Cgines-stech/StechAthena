    courseDescription:
      "The Programmable Logic Controllers course teaches students to interface with programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Programmable logic controllers are the brains of all  modern automation technology systems. In this course students develop a working knowledge and skill set in the following competencies: ladder logic, programming  standards, hardware selection, various inputs and outputs, communication, troubleshooting, setup and installation.",

    courseObjectives: [
      "Demonstrate a working knowledge of safety practices and procedures.",
      "Operate, install, maintain, and program programmable logic controller systems.",
      "Demonstrate a working knowledge of ladder logic programming.",
      "Apply motor control logic within a programmable logic controller system.",
      "Apply timers and event sequencing within a programmable logic controller system.",
      "Configure inputs and outputs for various applications.",
      "Apply systems diagnostics and troubleshooting of programmable logic control circuit",
