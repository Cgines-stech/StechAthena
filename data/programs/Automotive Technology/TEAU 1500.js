When you are in class or lab we encourage you to keep your cell phones put away in a secure location. If you use ear buds we ask that you only use one so you can still hear the things going on around you. If you are using your phone for things other than school related items, instructors will ask you to put them away. Please follow the direction of your instructors. Those who have been asked to refrain from using your cell phone and fail to do so will be asked to meet with the Director of Transportation and student services will be notified. The program is designed to provide the student with as much hands-on work as possible. In the automotive industry you may be required to lift heavy objects and stand for hours at a time to complete work required. Technicians deal with chemicals and materials which require caution, these will be identified in the Right to Know Agreement provided to you. You will also be required to use computers to track and complete work."
