    courseDescription:
      "The Emergency Medical Technician course provides training on out of hospital emergency medical care and transportation for critical and emergent patients who access the  emergency medical services (EMS) system. Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) have basic knowledge and skills necessary to stabilize and safely transport patients  ranging from non-emergency and routine medical transports to life threatening emergencies. EMTS function as part of a comprehensive EMS response system, under  medical oversight. EMTs perform interventions with the basic equipment typically found on an ambulance. EMTs are a critical link between the scene of an emergency and  the health care system.",
