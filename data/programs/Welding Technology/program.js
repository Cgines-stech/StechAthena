    programDescription:
      "In the Welding Technology certificate program, students receive hands-on safety, welding, and cutting instruction on a variety of metals. Instruction includes basic Oxy Fuel Cutting (OFC), Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW), Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), and other thermal and mechanical cutting processes. Students also learn welding process-specific and welding shop safety practices, basic print reading, and the proper uses and applications of AWS welding symbols.",

    programObjectives: [
      "Demonstrate welding safety on a daily basis.",
      "Use measurement systems, written instructions, and prints to complete welding projects.",
      "Use GMAW, FCAW, GTAW, and SMAW to perform high-quality welds on various metals correctly.",
      "Use thermal cutting equipment to perform high-quality cuts on ferrous and non-ferrous metals.",
      "Determine the correct welding and/or cutting process to use in specific applications.",
