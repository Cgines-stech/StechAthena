      <h3>Understanding Aligned and Non-Aligned Courses</h3>

      <p>
        At Southwest Technical College, our program catalog includes courses designed
        to meet both state and regional needs. The information below explains the
        difference between aligned and non-aligned courses.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Aligned Courses</strong><br>
        Aligned courses follow a standardized framework shared across all state
        institutions. These courses have the same course ID, name, description, and
        objectives, ensuring consistency and transferability within the state.
        Aligned courses are designed to provide a uniform foundation of knowledge
        and skills that meet statewide industry standards.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Non-Aligned Courses</strong><br>
        Non-aligned courses are tailored to meet the specific needs of regional
        employers and industry partners. These courses focus on skills and training
        that are directly relevant to the local job market, helping students become
        competitive and job-ready within our region.
